Hi, I'm Ben Hollingsworth.  No, not the Hollywood heartthrob actor, so don't bother googling me.

I fix things.  Computers, cars, houses... you name it.  I'm drawn toward anything that has room for improvement.
I'm equally handy with a keyboard, wrench, or hammer.

Professionally, I'm a talented C/C++ programmer and Linux/Unix system administrator with 35 years of professional experience.
I've worked across a variety of industries including finance, structural engineering, healthcare, telecommunications,
geospatial remote sensing, and government data.

My most current resume can always be downloaded from [here](https://www.jedi.com/obiwan/resume.pdf),
or you can view my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benholli).

I'll soon (fall of 2024) be finishing up my current job contract with Bloomberg and am actively looking for my next
contract or W2 job, so please reach out of you're hiring or know somebody who is.
I'm looking for a 100% remote software engineering job working primarily in C/C++ in a Linux environment.
